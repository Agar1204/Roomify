Roomify

Roomify transforms how you organize and decorate your living space. Snap a picture of your room, and Roomify identifies the furniture, offers optimization tips based on your chosen parameter—productivity, spaciousness, aesthetics, or storage— provides personalized furniture suggestions, allows you to keep an inventory of all past rooms, and more!

Inspiration
  Designing a room that balances functionality and aesthetics is often overwhelming. We wanted to create a tool that makes room organization intuitive, personalized, and actionable, helping   users create spaces that align with their lifestyle and goals.

What It Does
1. Room Analysis: Upload a photo of your room, and the app detects furniture and objects present.

2. Optimization Suggestions: Select one of four parameters:
      Productivity: Layout ideas to reduce distractions and improve focus.
      Spaciousness: Recommendations to declutter and maximize usable space.
      Aesthetics: Suggestions for a visually harmonious and stylish room.
      Storage & Organization: Tips for better storage solutions and organizational hacks.

3.Save Rooms: The app keeps an inventory of all past rooms and saves them to a database, allowing the user to access all their past rooms at any given time!

How We Built It
  Frontend: Developed using React Native with Expo Go, ensuring a smooth, responsive interface for mobile users.
  Backend: Built with Flask, handling image processing, furniture recognition, and database management.
  AI and Data Handling: Leveraged Python for object detection and analysis. Results were processed using JSON for efficient data communication between the front and backend.
  Database: Managed with SQLAlchemy to store room configurations and user preferences.
